# notes-app

Demo on how to run the notes app using docker and docker-compose

# Set up

To run the project, start the docker containers by running

```
docker-compose up -d
```

The project should be viewable on 'localhost:5000'. Give time for the docker container with the database to initialize.

You can check if the db has initialized by running 'docker ps' to check the name of the container running the db. 

Then run 'docker logs <container-name>' to check the logs to see if the db has started.

After the postresql db has started, you can then run 

```
docker-compose run --rm app /bin/sh -c "flask db init && flask db migrate && flask db upgrade"
```

This initializes the db for the flask app. With this you can navigate to 'localhost:5000' and you should see the login page.
